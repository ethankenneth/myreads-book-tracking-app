# How to contribute

The files in this repository are used in the Udacity Front End Nanodegree React course videos and are the starting point for all students. Because this is a submission for the Nanodegree, I will _not_ accept any pull or merge requests.

However, constructive feedback is always welcomed, so feel free to email me directly with any ideas.
